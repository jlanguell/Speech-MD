NOTE:

"
If the user clicks into the black console window, the cursor changes to a filled white rectangle, and the app hangs at the next Console.Write statement, until another click is made.
It is a generic feature of the Console window when its "QuickEdit Mode" is enabled.
In order to disable that feature, you should uncheck the "QuickEdit Mode" option of your app's console window at run-time.
